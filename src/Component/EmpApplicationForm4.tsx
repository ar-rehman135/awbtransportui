                              has also found its way into the trucking industry. The purpose of this policy is to reduce highway
                              accidents that result from driver misuse of drugs and alcoholic substances, thereby reducing fatalities,
                              injuries, and property damage. The Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety
                              Administration, has established extensive regulations requiring testing under certain circumstances. In

                              may be required, the procedures for conducting such testing and the methods and procedures for complying
